test="""We wrote about it I think, but I think we haven't talked about it last time about the EPS GA. As Tino explained, I think it was written also to you, I am not sure what Bruno said. I explained it to you because Tino also explained it to me. EPS offers its main functionality or its main advantage against IAM if it is used in more than one region. So we currently only have it active only for Aspiegel, yes, but we only have it in EOTE currently. For UNL it is basically activating the APIs there. There is no deployment, there are no nodes that need to be deployed there for enabling it in UNL, but we need to enable the APIs. So that is what would need to be done. But the bigger issue I think is that I just learned this morning that the APIs of EPS have never been tested on TSI. Well, Aspiegel is already using it for quite a while, so I hope they are not completely bad. But nevertheless, we would need to have some quality tests, except for the tests of the APIs from our testers. Or we can launch it in front of the other customers, definitely. So if I just check if I get it right. So quality tests, yes, sure, I agree to have a quality test. But quality tests at EOTE region or EOML region? We can do it at the EOTE region because it is testing the APIs. So the APIs will be the same for UNL and EOTE. So we could, with the already existing solution we have, we can do the testing, the functional testing of the APIs, the quality testing. So that is not an issue. When will the test be done? That is not so nice information because we do have the Cloud Firewall testing, right? And I don't want to delay the Cloud Firewall testing in order to have the EPS GA earlier. Yes, I know, but the Cloud Firewall is just one server and I don't think you don't have enough for them to do so, right? Because you have more than one QA. Ah, barely, barely, let's say so, right? So I have two, yeah, I have two and a half testers. Yes, that's more than enough. One of those is doing the quality testing, so testing the UI, testing everything working as intended and stuff like that. He is fully busy with Cloud Firewall testing it. Okay, that's cool. It is currently on vacation, but he is back, he will continue testing it. I have another tester who is focusing on the APIs, reviewing the documentation. He is also reviewing the EPS documentation you provided, so that is his job. And also testing all the APIs from the beginning to the end, right? Creating all these bugs and stuff like that, taking care that the bugs are handed over to T-Ball and that he also understands what is going on there and so on and so forth, right? And I have one tester that is shared with another squad, a database squad. So I only have 50% of him and he is quite new. He is with us now for three weeks, I think. And, yeah, almost four weeks, anyway. Almost four weeks. So he starts to really do testing, but he was in the onboarding first. And he is supporting then in the API testing, so Lukas in his part. But I need this one and a half, even if the new tester is fully in working mode, right? I need these one and a half testers full time to get the Cloud Firewall tested as soon as possible, right? Because the testing task is a task that can be parallelized very well for the APIs. I do the following APIs, you do the next one, right? And that is very good and that speeds up the testing progress there. So I would not say, OK, one of the testers is now doing the EPS API testing because the Cloud Firewall, I think, Ketino correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's better business potential than going GA with EPS. EPS is free service. Yes, yes, it's free service indeed. But we're hiding the EPS for a long time and it causes a lot of problems when we're ever trying to GA any service, not just our squad, the other squad also have the similar problem. I guess now the problem is just testing, right? Otherwise, it's very used product by at least one customer. Question B, what is your timing for CFW testing and can we then directly continue with EPS? That's the goal, right? So the timing is, let me have a look. Let me open here. So the goal is to be done mid of September with the testing actually. So we planned the whole API for testing for the firewall and then it should be done. It depends a bit on how much we find there and so on and so forth, right? But it's realistic that we will be done mid of September with everything, QA, API testing and stuff like that. We're testing hopefully already having some fixes for some bugs we had. That's a bit pessimistic actually. So, being finished with the testing completely so that we can go live afterwards with the… so afterwards going live, so beginning of next API, go live with CFW. It depends of course a bit on there are some dependencies, right? If we see that the quality is not as expected, if we see that there are issues, especially in security testing but they finished security testing and they told me that there are no bigger issues. That should be fine. But if we see in the quality or in the functional testing that there are some unexpected issues, that something is not working as intended or whatever, then this might be delayed. But I don't expect that currently and I don't hope so. So that's just a word of warning of course that there might be delays in case such things happen. Yes, but I still think September is way too long. You have people working… If we are done earlier Joshua, then we are done earlier, right? So that's fair enough. But we need to do our testing. If my testers say I need to do it until the middle of September for testing it, then I trust them. I just hope your testers do their work. Do their work like five days per week. I hope you know what I'm saying. Right now it's early July and always betting time is September, which gives me a feeling that… Let me say it that way. My testers, especially Lukas, tested several services already. The timeline he provides me is of course biased by the fact that the APIs of the last service he got, that he needed to test were so bad, that there were so many bugs, that he needed to prolong the tests all the time. So if the API for the Cloud Firewall is very good, then he will be done earlier. That's fine. There's no issue at all. But based on the experiences we had, we'd rather plan a bit more time, instead of delaying the release of the feature again and again and again, because we have too many bugs that need to be fixed before we can launch. So it doesn't help us right now to say, yes, we are done. That thing is bad, yes, I hear enough, and I do hope we can give some detail. What is bad? Which server is bad? How is bad? We talked about planning. I haven't said that the API is bad, but we present more. It was. Have a look on the bugs we have opened for the HSS APIs. I can't even count them. There are so many. The major things we have fixed, it's all fine. It's all good. I don't want to complain. It delays our... After this meeting, I will ask my people to open the bug TV and see what exactly is going on there. Sure. That's fine, right? I don't want to tackle now half things. I don't want to hide about some things that happened in the past. Well, for HSS, there are still a lot of minor bugs opened, but they will be fixed in time sooner or later. That's okay. But for HSS, we also planned to launch way earlier. In the end, we needed to postpone it again and again because you know the story. In the end, both sides were angry. You want to free up your resources. I can completely understand that. On the other side, it was still the other side. Then also me afterwards, I wanted to get that done. I wanted to launch it. It doesn't help us if I say now, okay, yes, let's plan to launch CFW in August. We are in the same situation and we can't launch because nothing is ready. I rather say we test until mid-September because from what we experienced in the past, how many bugs we usually get in the testing there, I can only use this as a parameter for my planning. Then I say, okay, it takes longer than I want, than I'd like to, but I need to plan it accordingly. If we are then done two weeks earlier, fair enough. That's good. But delaying it again and again is something I'd like to avoid. Of course, we tell something to our customers and if we tell our customers, it will launch in September and then we need to tell them, sorry, no, we will launch in October, no, we will launch in November or something like that. That's bad. That's not good for our reputation. Yes, but that's not the point I want to talk about. Yes, I completely understand what you are saying, but I just want you to make sure your team, your QA is actually working. They are working. They are not creating bug tickets all of a sudden. So they are testing these things. Because from my experience in the last year, yes, from my side also have a bad experience. People gone for weeks, months, yes, months, disappear for the whole month. Nothing gets done. They just vanish, disappear. Not since I'm here, so I can't talk about that. I guess one of the people we kicked out. Yes, something bad and bad consequences will come, which is none of us will be willing to see that coming. So just make sure people are actually working and things going forward smoothly. Definitely. And also maybe one thing for you I'd like to improve a bit, because what I am a bit afraid of or what I had a feeling a bit in the past was regarding testing. They were a bit lacking this, okay, when is the testing phase ended? Testing phase ended. Yes, because if I tell a quality tester, please test the product, he can test it forever. Yes, indeed. He will always find bugs, new bugs here and new bugs there. It will never finish, the quality testing of anything. That's important for me that I together with the testers define clear goals. We say okay, until this point we do test and then it's done, then it's tested, and then we close the test case. Because that's currently not existing that precisely. I think that's important also for better planning for everyone. If we know okay, we test that much and then it's okay. That is also clearly communicated then also to you about our... Yes, we do have some common understanding with the OTC's management. It says what is a blocker, what is no blocker is very clearly written. What is no blocker is very clearly written down in some page in the reference. Yes, exactly, I know. If it's a blocker or something serious, we will take care of that immediately. But if it's quality, some minor stuff, I say we just create a back ticket and wait for R&D to fix it in the future version. That's clear, that's not what I'm referring to. For me it's like when do our testers stop testing? Because actually I should never launch a ticket because if the testers are still testing, they could still find blocker bugs. But it's not that likely anymore after a specific amount of time, after they are basically already tested with everything. But what does it mean I tested everything? You can never say I test everything. For APIs you can say okay, I have a routine, I test this, it's all fine. But especially quality you can never stop testing actually. Nevertheless, we need to define, I need to define with the testers something like now it's considered test is done, the initial test is done, it's fine, bugs are handed over to Huawei, you are fixing the most important ones, where the blocker is the highest priority things, and then we are only doing retesting. We check, okay, have the bugs been fixed or if a new functionality is added to some new update or whatsoever with a version upgrade, then we are doing the functional testing again in a limited amount, let's say so, with only things that can be affected with this update. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was referring to. But it's fine, we don't need to discuss it too much. I just wanted to inform you that we are also planning to do something in that regard because it's better for the predictability of the test in the future. Okay, we talked way more about EPSGA than I expected actually. I would suggest that we move over to HSS or do you want to talk about HSS first? No, one question would be just so, can we at least in uncommitted states say then we can include some EPS tasks in the next pip? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. In the next pip, definitely, so probably even committed. Okay. Because we will not have too much stuff to be done for cloud firewall anymore in next pip. Do we need anything from Joshua or Kibo for this task for EPS? Anything? Yes, but we are already preparing that currently in parallel a bit regarding what exactly we need to do to enable the APIs for UNL. But that should be a no-brainer actually, it should not be too much. Okay, so I could also put EPS on our roadmap somewhere at the end of this year. Yes. Okay. Good. Then I'm totally fine to move on with HSS because it's a bit, let's say, pressuring because as you saw Joshua, we announced the public webinar at the end of this month. So we better be prepared to show it live in the production environment. Yes, I will also, I'm also preparing the ransomware protection video. I'm recording a video and a short demo and hopefully you can also reproduce it. I was still working on that. And hopefully I will have some news today or tomorrow. That's nice. How could we get the ransomware that you have the ice fire there, the ice fire? Do I ever show you the ice fire? If you want it, I can send it to you. You can buy it in the black dark web. No, I'm kidding. I haven't been there yet. I will send you sometime in the future. Okay. Would be very interested in it to try it also out in some VM. Hopefully we can do the demo so that you can reproduce it. Perfect. Cool. Thank you. That's cool. Basically, I also showed HSS the current status to some sales colleagues last Friday as I told you. So basically I mostly received positive feedback that these kind of solutions are requested by customers because they want to see their, say, security posture and want to do things, vulnerability management and so on. But I received three main points where I opened also a bug ticket. I don't know if it's a bug or if it's working as designed. First of all, I guess you talked already about that one, is the compatibility with current operating systems. So the customers, we also advise them to only use or to update to the most current supported operating system. A lot of them use, for example, Windows Server 2022. And officially we are not supporting some newer versions of HSS. So HSS is supporting the newer version operating system. Yes, indeed. I haven't taken this with me, but I hope I can take this with me now. That would be really, really cool because I know there will be questions from the customers on this webinar. Like, OK, I have Windows Server 2022. When will it be supported? Because we support older versions, but the customers, they are not even allowed themselves to use, for example, Windows Server 2008. I guess that's out of support since, I don't know, a few years. And that would be really necessary to have up to date operating system support. That would be cool. OK, I will ask the HSS R&D later. Yes, that's great. Secondly, it's about the vulnerability database. I guess you will then update it once a month or what is the lifecycle because we haven't documented it somewhere in the docs page. Customers will see or ask. Currently, the database is two months old for vulnerabilities. When will it be updated and how often? I think you just answer yourself once per month, right? Is it, let's say, agreed, aligned? Can we document this in the help center somewhere? So is it fixed? Processed? This is more like maintenance stuff. Our SIE will help you update the HSS every month. Do you imply that they are not doing their job? No, no, no, no, no. What I imply is I want to have it documented because otherwise... You want to write it down somewhere, OK. Yeah, because the people are asking me when will it be updated and then the next day another guy is asking me when will it be updated. Then I can provide a link here in the doc center. It states once a month is the update cycle. You can also communicate this to customers. Please don't ask me again. This kind of way that we have this lifecycle of vulnerability database update somewhere in the help center. I mean, if you say once a month, is it like end of the month, start of the month or something? When do we usually do that? Because then I would ask... The official statement is as long as they have the update on the center, on the HSS, then you can upgrade it. You can, based on the HSS support center, you can do the upgrade. And the HSS support center is updated every month. OK, so I guess that's something that we need to discuss, Sebastian, when you would like to plan it. And then we say, OK, like every, I don't know, every last Friday of the month or every last week of the month, we update the database and put that one somewhere in the docs page. And then we kind of kill this question by different people. I would clarify that. That's good. OK. I'll write it down. I will ask the MD later. Probably tomorrow, day off earlier in Wednesday. Cool. And then I had the last thing. It's about if you install the agent or if you download the agent, at least on Windows, I don't know if it's only on Windows, and you double click on the X, you get a notification about unsigned software and that it is blocked. So people then asking why is it seen as unsecure? So is it possible to somehow sign this agent that you can just install it without any blocking by the operating system? Let me see if I get it right. So you install the agent, you double click the agent and you what? Let me see the story I shared with you as well. So I also shared some screenshots with you. Can you give me a screenshot later? I can do it now. You prepare a screenshot and I will see what's up with Andy. So just three things for HSSRI. One is supporting the latest operating system. Second thing is to upgrade the database. The third thing is whatever you just said. Then I have just one question. Because our documentation says HSS is working on cloud and off-cloud like on-premise and on different clouds. Theoretically it's doable. Okay, so practically we need to make the communication then available to the Internet, right? Yes, you need to. Based on R&D you need to have ECS ask the trans, what's that called? Transfers, transmin, transplats the message. 

You will have ECS on the OTC and taking care of the message that agent from other clouds send it to here. I didn't understand you. We need a proxy virtual machine? I think so. I think that's what it means. A POSTEC virtual machine. Do we have a documentation for customers how they can do it? Because customers are already asking, okay, can I protect my on-premise virtual machines? And based on our documentation the answer is yes, sure you can also protect your VMs on-premise with our solution. Of course, they pay the agent and if they also use the on-premise VMs it's more revenue for us. But we don't have any documentation how to do it because currently you download the agent and then it has some configuration. And this is just internally so it only works when you are inside OTC but not like on-premise or AWS or Azure or somewhere. Okay, just need a document. If you have any guideline how to make it work for on-premise VMs, like I install just the virtual machine on my laptop, I install HSS agent, how do I configure it to work with my tenant? Like what do you call it? Off-cloud, on-cloud, third party cloud, something like that. Okay, and that are the main points from my point which I received as feedback so far. I opened some other boxes in this ticket but these are not really blocker ones. And I will send you then the link with this signature thing after the meeting. One question for HSS I have is about file integrity management. Let me just open my tenant and then I share the screen. Okay, so I have a file integrity monitoring. So I have a file integrity monitoring. File integrity monitoring, what is that? Let me just open my tenant and then I share the screen. So when I go to HSS I have a lot of features and one of them is file integrity monitoring. What does it do? How can I enable it? In the documentation there is nothing to find about how to enable it. I tested it, it works just fine and it is hard to explain. Maybe I will show you a demo later. That would be nice because I have nothing to show and I have no... For web developer protection I can add a server but for file integrity monitoring I don't know. You need to get into the virtual machine and change some critical system file. If you change it it will trigger this function. I think automatically I am not quite sure. Okay, because again the documentation... If you go where is it? File integrity monitoring. You can view here but there is basically not that much and checking change details. But what is monitored? What is a critical file? What is the details? Which folder or which file is critical for HSS that is not documented? I don't know when it should even trigger if you know what I mean. I don't know what you mean. You said if you change some file... Which? System-wise file. You know you log into the Linux virtual machine, if you type ls it will list all the files under the folder right? This ls is system command. Somewhere in the system you have this system file. It is reasonable. If you go there, delete this ls and ls command and you will find that... Okay, I am a virtual fire. For example if I go to Windows and System33, these are system files here. So if I delete any of that on the virtual machine it will be identified. The question would be which folders are monitored? So what is a system file? It would be interesting to know which files are protected by it. Because for me if I see fire integrity monitoring I would also be interested in having something like an audit configuration to be protected. Because if someone is tampering around with my logging configurations, well it is interesting for me. I want to know. Is it now considered a system critical file? Maybe it is. But maybe it is not. What is monitored? What is a critical file? Maybe I can add a folder later? I don't know. I cannot use the system settings in HSS. It is just empty. But if you can give us some demo that would be really helpful to understand it and also show it to customers. Okay. Or maybe just a few screenshots. Also fine. Just to see how it works. Just one example. Okay. Cool. And I guess that is it from HSS side, from my part. Do you have anything on your mind Sebastian? I suppose the HSS is not... I want to try out to camper with my audit. Sorry, my contact. So to... Oh, I am mistyped. To... To check it. Yeah, actually. Anyway. But for HSS... ... on my page right now. Hi, Tibor. Hi, Tibor. We only have 15 minutes left, 40 minutes left. But we still have the topic of DWAF in UNL. Tino, you wanted to talk about? Was there a customer request? Yes, so I worked with customer impediment. And we just received a customer impediment for customers in the Netherlands. They also would... I guess it is not the second customer. They want also to have the dedicated DWAF on the Netherlands regions. Because they need to fulfill their requirements to use DWAF, but not put the web server in the internet. Which is necessary for the shared DWAF. And I guess either way, somehow later on we want to have feature parity. That all services we deploy on German region are also available on the Netherlands region. Otherwise, yeah, we do not attract customers to this region when a lot of services are missing. Question would be if and how we can also plan to deploy the dedicated DWAF on the Netherlands region. If that is something where we need a lot of effort, a lot of time. Because I mean we already have it live on the German region. What is necessary to start dedicated DWAF on the Netherlands region? So if it is something we can put on the roadmap in midterm. Yeah, yes. Can you say something about this Joshua? Is it possible that we can also focus on dedicated DWAF in the Netherlands region? The answer should be yes. But first it depends on the customer wise. Because I never hear this customer on our side. I don't know why and when and how much profit they are going to bring us. Basically, I mean the motivation to do this is sufficient. And the second thing is it's more like it's not a new service, right? It's already deployed on the UD. We just need to do some upgrades on the testbed. Is that upgrades on the testbed? No, no, no. The Netherlands doesn't have that, right? That's the new service delivery. That's no good. So I can answer you the first question. I mean officially you are not allowed to know customer names. I don't need their names, but I need their industry and... It's education and it's more like... you know Telus? Telus, yes, I know. It's a partner customer, let's say, from educational and meteorological sector. Let's say. You know this earth observation stuff. This kind of customer and they need to use dedicated DWAF. Because the shared DWAF would not fulfill their security requirements. They would be quiet by kind of end of this year. And if we cannot provide dedicated DWAF, then of course they use a third party solution. Yeah, for UNL we don't have a test environment as you know. Yes, for your information, and yes I kind of got the background. But I still think our side is not the main problem. But please aware we still have a lot of servers like CBH, like Seqmaster, like CCM. A lot of servers are in the queue. Which I don't see is prepared to deliver in this year anyhow. And you say if we don't get it at the end of this year, they will go to have third party solutions. So I think you should ask Sebastian what is his plan, whether he have enough people for doing that. Just for my understanding, basically as we have it live on Germany, it's not that much effort, right? Because I mean it's a known service or? We still have some effort because in Germany basically it means the testbed already have these servers. We can, at least now we can, we skip the testbed as standard procedure. We skip the testbed because testbed already have and deploy there into the Netherlands. And it will cause, still it's like a new source delivery. And you said I should further talk to Sebastian, so basically from yours? You, Sebastian, like give us an idea when you think you can do it. Sebastian, give me an idea of what he can, is it possible this year? Let's play the game further. I have no clue how much effort it is to implement it rather than even so. I need to analyze this for people. Yeah, if you calculated the previous one on UB, it was a lot of time especially with the testing. I already tested it, it's the same package which is already on production and deployed on production because we don't have tests. But I guess it still requires the test, right? Yes, but you can only test on production environment, right? Yes. Okay, so you... What we would need to do Tino is actually we would need to deploy it there. Unfortunately, your assumption is that to say, yeah, but we already did it, right? It should be the same and there should not be any surprises. I'm afraid that does not work that way. We are doing this, we are deploying on production anyway, we are hiding in the console and we did some simple small tests. We are supposed to be quicker, no death row, I mean, no death row, like a completely new server. It will be quicker but we are still doing some tests. But for example, we could put it on production and whitelist only this week and say, okay, it's live and beta status, we are still testing it. But we have it live in, I don't know, let's say October or November, December, whatever. So we have it there, it's still in testing phase but you can start to use it and do your proof of concept and whatever and in the meantime we are testing it. Next PI will have capacities for implementing this, Tino. That's not an issue, right? Yes. That's definitely fine. It depends on the speed of implementation, right? Because although we already implemented it in the UDE... The UDE is a bit different than EODE unfortunately. So it's not like, okay, we do the same thing just again, right? And everything will be working out fine. So there might be like, oh no, that does not work, we need to do something else. The network in NL is completely different to the EODE one, right? So especially with regards to communications, there might be some mess in the UNL and we might need to do troubleshooting and finding out, okay, together with the network connectivity squad. That can cause us delays of two months. Totally fine. Just want to... You know the deadlines by customers are not so strict usually, so nobody's dying. And if we say, okay, we plan it somewhere next quarter and you may get it, they may wait usually and say, okay, at least you have it on your roadmap and we can wait two months. That's totally fine. So it's a totally different story that we say, no, we don't do. Please go to the competitor. That's another story. So you have the capacity to have it in your... to deploy it in UNL from my perspective. So from implementation capacity point of view, right? If Huawei does have the capacity to support us there in the implementation, that is completely fine for me. Yeah. We tomorrow have the capacity to doing this. Can you? Tomorrow? No. You see? So give me a day. Yeah, that's right. Next TI. So mid of September we can start. Mid of September. Okay. I will say we keep this topic and discussion next next room and meeting. Okay. Totally fine. We don't have that much time left. I have two items. I would like just to ask it's about the DBSS support from MySQL. That's the plan for next TI, but will be done quicker, right? So that is somehow in progress already. MySQL is planned this TI. This PI. This PI. Okay. Let me check. Let me check. Instead of me talking something wrong, we are talking about pre-production only. Talk production that customer can use it. Okay. I am having pre-production will be doing this PI next PI production. Sorry. Okay. So this is still on track. And the other one is the DWAF support for WAF instance. That is planned for also this PI already. The WAF ERB mode, yes. Also having pre-production is this PI. And what next PI? Next hopefully because we are depending there on network services. No, network services support. Network services support for the ERB upgrade. Okay. They don't get that done. They planned to get that done with the PI, but uncommitted. Okay. Good. And then just one last thing. Joshua, you offered kind of again an introduction session for cloud-based channel CBH. Can we plan it for somewhere? I don't know. This week, next week? You call. Sorry? You call. You call the time. Okay. Tomorrow 11? Tomorrow? Tomorrow? I have time tomorrow. I don't know how about you. I have time. Friday? Friday is quite packed for me at least. I'd like to join. For me also. Then maybe next week after our meeting at 11? Yeah, that's fine. I will schedule something, okay? Okay. How much time do you need? One hour? One hour should be more than enough. Yeah, if you had done earlier then that's fine. So next week, Monday, next week, Monday 11 a.m. CBH introduction session. Yes, who else wants to join? So Kino, Joshua, me? I will forward the invite to the necessary people. Kino, someone from your side who needs to join? And if they are not available I will propose another time. Okay, perfect. I guess from our side just you and me to just get an overview of the service and the fit. Yeah, that's totally fine. Okay, I guess. Yeah, time is over. That's our invitation. Maybe we could talk about so much things. But then I would say we talk again next Monday for next topics. Just one second, do you have an extra minute? Yes, yes. Thank you. Alright. Thank you Kino, thank you Joshua. Thanks Kino, thanks Joshua. Thank you. I also wanted a minute of you Sebastian, can I also stay? If you are interested in it. So Kino, if it's not that secret that you don't want to share with Kino, then it's fine with me. Okay, see you. Alright Joshua, then take care, bye. Bye bye.
